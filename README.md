# Jan-1: Hear the Math.

*Created by Ale Mustafa* 
"Mathematics is like a music of reason, you just have to hear it." Inspired by Niels Bohr.

## Overview :)

**Jan-1** is an interactive educational project that explores the connection between mathematics, sound, and biology. Users can input mathematical functions to see their graphs and hear their corresponding audio patterns. The project also visualizes mathematical structures found in natural forms such as leaves and DNA.

## Features:
- Live graph plotting of user-defined functions (i.e: sin(x), x^2, tan(x), |x^3|, etc)
- Dynamic sound playback linked to the mathematical behavior of the function.
- Two interactive visualizations:
  - **Figure 1: Leaf Structure**/Users can click nodes on a stylized leaf to view biological math patterns.
  - **Figure 2: DNA Spiral**/Clickable DNA points reveal functions based on real molecular symmetry and helices.

## Technologies and tools that are used:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- [math.js](https://mathjs.org/), for evaluating mathematical expressions
- [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/), for graph plotting
- Open-source tone (.mp3) files served via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
- Hosted using GitHub Pages.

## How to Use :/ ??

1. Visit the hosted web page (through the link which is available below).
2. Enter any valid mathematical expression like: cos(x)..etc.
3. Click (Plot & Play) to see the graph and hear a corresponding tone.
4. Explore the interactive leaf and DNA diagrams by clicking on marked points to reveal underlying equations.

## Mathematics in Biology:

- **Figure 1: Leaf**/ Demonstrates symmetry, parabolic curves, and vein structures that relate to real plant growth models.
- **Figure 2: DNA**/ Simulates the helical structure of DNA using sine functions and parametric curves.

^^Please do note that these visuals are not literal replications, but stylized mathematical interpretations that reflect genuine biological forms.^^

--Ale Mustafa-- 
A mathematics enthusiast exploring how abstract equations can be visualized and heard, in this project I am inspired by the structures of the natural world.
I have created this project as a  senior's year project in High School.
