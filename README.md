# Jan-1: Hear The Math.

*Created by Ale Mustafa*

This is a minimalist web project showing how **mathematics can be both seen and heard**. It allows users to:

- Input any mathematical function and see it graphed live.
- Hear sounds mapped to functions such as: sin(x) plays a sine wave tone.
- Explore the presence of math in biology via two interactive visual graphs:
  
  - Fig 1: Leaf patterns
  - Fig 2: DNA spiral

## How It Works? :/
- (Plotly) is used for graph visualization.
- (Math.js) handles the function parsing.
- (MP3) tones are triggered dynamically via (JavaScript) and (<audio>).
- All assets are hosted via (CDN).

--Ale Mustafa-- 
An enthusiast exploring how abstract equations can be visualized and heard, in this project I am inspired by the structures of the natural world.
I have created this project as my senior's year project in High School.
