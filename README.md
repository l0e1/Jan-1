## About

**Jan-1** is a project that shows math can be experienced with both the eyes and ears. 
Users can type in math functions, see their graphs, and hear sound waves that reflect those functions.

This project was created to make math more interactive and meaningful — especially for students who want to connect creativity with logic.

## What are the features?

- Enter any math function (e.g., `sin(x)`, `x^2`, `|x^3|`).
- See the graph using Plotly.js .
- Hear a matching tone for each function.
- Styled with neon green text on black background.

## Sounds:

Others: [sine-330hz.mp3](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jackw01/sine-wave-tone/sine-330hz.mp3) 

These are public MP3s from a GitHub CDN. They play directly in the browser.

## How to Use it?

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type any math function (example: `sin(x)`)
3. Click **"Plot Graph"** to draw the function
4. Click **"Play Sound"** to hear the sound of mathematics!
