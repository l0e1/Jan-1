# Jan-1: Hear The Math
*Author: Ale Mustafa*

## Purpose
Jan-1 is an educational web application designed to demonstrate the relationship between mathematical functions, their graphical representation, and corresponding audio tones. It also includes two biology inspired visualizations a leaf pattern and a DNA helix, showing how mathematical equations manifest in natural forms. The goal is to provide a free, accessible tool for students, teachers, and researchers who wish to explore or demonstrate these concepts in classrooms, laboratories, or personal study.

## Tools & Technologies

- **HTML5 & CSS3**  
- **JavaScript**  
  - [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/) for evaluating user (input) expressions  
  - [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for interactive graphs  
- **Audio Playback** via the HTML Audio API. 
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting.  

All dependencies are open-source and free to use.
